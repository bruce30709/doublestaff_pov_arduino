# Doublestaff POV Arduino

Feeling great about this cost-effective entertainment solution!

Whether it's for an LED staff, car, motorcycle, home, laptop, or sound system, this setup is versatile and fun.

**Components (Not Including Pipes):**

- Tiny85: NT. 70 * 4
- WS2812B LEDs: NT. 220/m * 2
- Jumpwire: NT. 40 * 1
- Rechargeable Battery (9v): NT. 170 * 4  

**Total Cost: NT. 1500**

Despite my initial failure, ended up spending NT 2000.

A bit disappointing, but all in the spirit of sharing! No criticism here, just lessons learned!
